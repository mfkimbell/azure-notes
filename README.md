## Status Codes
* 400 bad request
* 401 unauthorized
* 403 forbidden
* 404 not found

### 409 
* The 409 Conflict error is an HTTPS status code that indicates a conflict between a client's request and the current state of a resource. This error usually occurs in response to a PUT request. For example, a 409 error may occur when uploading a file that is older than an existing file on the server.


  
### 502 Bad Gateway
* The HTTP 502 status code indicates that one server on the internet received an invalid response from another server. It is a gateway or proxy server error, and it is usually indicative of issues between servers on the backend rather than with the client directly. Key aspects include:
* Gateway/Proxy: It occurs when a gateway or proxy server, which is acting as an intermediary for the client, receives an invalid response from the upstream server.
* Configuration Issues: This error can often result from network misconfigurations or servers failing to respond properly.
* Potential Causes: Causes might include servers being down, network errors, or faulty programming in the backend that the gateway is unable to handle.

### 503 Service Unavailable:
* The HTTP 503 status code means that the server is currently unable to handle the request because it is temporarily overloaded or down for maintenance. There is no inherent problem with the request itself, but the server is simply unable to process it at this time. Here are some key points about the HTTP 503 error:
* Temporary: This error suggests a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. It is often used when servers undergo maintenance or are temporarily overloaded.
* Retry-After Header: Servers can optionally include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait before making a new request.
* Load Balancers: In a scenario with load balancers, this error might indicate that all servers are too busy or down.

## Azure Webjobs (AWS LAMBDA/STEP + EVENT BRIDGE)
* background jobs/tasks that run for an application
* Azure WebJobs is a feature of Azure App Service that enables you to run a program or script in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app. WebJobs are often used to run background tasks as part of an application. They can be triggered by a schedule (timer-based), by an event (such as a queue message being added), or run continuously.

## Azure Activity Log
* all about changes to resources
Azure Activity Log is a service that provides an audit trail of all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) made to resources in your Azure account. It records when resources are modified or deleted, who made changes, and what operations were performed. While useful for security and audit purposes, the Azure Activity Log does not provide information about the performance of resources, only about operations performed on them.

## Azure Search

## Azure Logic Apps (AWS Step Functions)

## Azure Audit Log
* contains the history of sign-in activity and audit trail of changes made within a particular tenant
  
## Azure Traffic Analytics
Azure Traffic Analytics is a solution that provides visibility into network traffic by analyzing the NSG flow logs (Network Security Group Flow Logs). It allows you to understand which users and applications are consuming bandwidth, helps identify traffic flow patterns, and detects network anomalies. However, this tool is more focused on network-level insights and traffic flow rather than overall performance metrics related to CPU, memory, or disk, which are typically involved in general performance issues.

## Azure Log Analytics (AWS Cloudwatch Logs)
Azure Log Analytics is a tool within the Azure Monitor suite. It collects telemetry and other data from a variety of sources and provides a query language for complex analytics, insights, and the ability to act on the collected data.

Here are the core features of Azure Log Analytics:

Data Collection: Gathers data from various sources like Azure resources, on-premises environments, and other cloud platforms.
Advanced Queries: Uses Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze collected data for patterns, anomalies, and trends.
Alerting: Allows you to create alerts based on metrics or query results.
Integration: Works closely with other Azure services, including Azure Automation and Azure Security Center, for a comprehensive monitoring solution.

## Azure Notification Hub (aws SNS)

## Azure Storage Queue (aws SQS)


## Azure Advisor
* a personalized cloud consultancy service provided by Microsoft Azure. It analyzes your deployed Azure resources and offers recommendations to optimize your Azure environment. The goal of Azure Advisor is to help you improve the cost-effectiveness, performance, reliability, and security of your applications and services running on Azure
